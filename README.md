## Introduction

The award-winning OpenFPGA framework is the **first open-source FPGA IP generator with silicon proofs** supporting highly-customizable FPGA architectures. OpenFPGA provides complete EDA support for customized FPGAs, including Verilog-to-bitstream generation and self-testing verification. OpenFPGA opens the door to democratizing FPGA technology and EDA techniques with agile prototyping approaches and constantly evolving EDA tools for chip designers and researchers.

> [!TIP]
> If this is your first time working with OpenFPGA, we strongly recommend you watch the [introduction video about OpenFPGA](https://youtu.be/ocODUGcYGqo)

A quick overview of OpenFPGA tools can be found [**here**](https://openfpga.readthedocs.io/en/master/tutorials/getting_started/tools/).
We also recommend potential users check out the summary of [**technical capabilities**](https://openfpga.readthedocs.io/en/master/overview/tech_highlights/#) before compiling.
